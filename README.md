# simple retrainer of a simple linear regression

The project is the same as the one presented during the demonstration.

We have a deployed linear regression model using an API.
We update the model with the API every 30 seconds according to new random data

This project is a small demonstration of the concept of MLops, for better use of MLops, you should use Kubeflow (detailed in the Kubeflow folder).
